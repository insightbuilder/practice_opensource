This repo was born out of a challenge that is faced by many tech and non-tech professionals in the industry when it comes to building their ideas into Open Source projects, and work on the asynchronously.
If you are curious what are the tools you can use to work asynchronously, refer to the video below https://youtu.be/oOOoZ0hF_Pc 

The idea is to create this repo, and make it the center of the video where I discuss about the steps that I had followed. The challenge to idea flow is also explained in the video, that will be updated below later.

Welcome to Practice Opensource repo, where we learn how to open source your own projects. There are many reasons for sharing your idea, code and knowledge to the community. You might be using Agentic IDE like Cursor / Cline to build your idea. There will be multiple sittings required before you have any workable solution.

So this repo becomes a place where you will store whatever got created in a sitting. When you build your project in public, initially you will be only one coding, and getting the things setup. The repo allows you to work with multiple versions of yourself. The repo will be the memory bank or storage which your future self can easily look at understand. This type of working is also called Asynchronous Working.
